# noise-reduction-sketch

A simple test project to try out cmake and opencv, and at the same time see how useful temporal median might be as a simple method for reducing noise and other artifacts in images of static scenes.

Note that I am very much a beginner at this so expect this code to be very bad. Advice is welcome but don't expect too many improvements on this particular repository as it is just a test.
